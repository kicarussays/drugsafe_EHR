## Abstract
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. It is recognized as one of the most significant hospital-acquired infections. Although CDI can develop severe complications and spores of Clostridioides difficile can be transmitted by the fecal-oral route, CDI is occasionally overlooked in clinical settings. Thus, it is necessary to monitor high CDI risk groups, particularly those undergoing antibiotic treatment, to prevent complications and spread. We developed and validated a deep learning-based model to predict the occurrence of CDI within 28 days after starting antibiotic treatment using longitudinal electronic health records. For each patient, timelines of vital signs and laboratory tests with a 35-day monitoring period and a patient information vector consisting of age, sex, comorbidities, and medications were constructed. Our model achieved the prediction performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.932–0.973) in internal validation and 0.972 (95% CI: 0.968–0.975) in external validation. Platelet count and body temperature emerged as the most important features. The risk score, the output value of the model, exhibited a consistent increase in the CDI group, while the risk score in the non-CDI group either maintained its initial value or decreased. Using our CDI prediction model, high-risk patients requiring symptom monitoring can be identified. This could help reduce the underdiagnosis of CDI, thereby decreasing transmission and preventing complications.
